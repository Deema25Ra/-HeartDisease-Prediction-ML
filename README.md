# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning on two distinct datasets: "Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" and "Heart Disease Health Indicators."

## Models

1. **Random Forest (RF):** Demonstrated high accuracy and recall.
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Proved effective for complex datasets but with lower accuracy.
3. **Neural Networks (NN):** Balanced performance, competitive accuracy.

## Results

### Personal Key Indicators Dataset:
- **Random Forest (RF):** Accuracy 81.79%, Recall 85.61%
- **SVM:** Accuracy 75.22%, Recall 75%
- **NN:** Accuracy 77.11%, Recall 77%

### Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset:
- **Random Forest (RF):** Accuracy 97.07%, Recall 99.80%
- **SVM:** Accuracy 70.61%, Recall 71%
- **NN:** Accuracy 77.32%, Recall 77%

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model outperformed others, showcasing its robustness in handling heart disease classification tasks. Challenges included addressing class imbalance.
